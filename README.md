# Binary Trees Overview #
The scripts contained in this repository are implementations and operations of a binary tree, binary search tree, avl tree and binary heap.  

## General ##
What is a binary tree?  
A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children called a left child and a right child.  If a node has only one child, the other child is pointed to NULL.    
If a node doesn't have children, it's called a leaf node.  The nodes are unordered, thus would be slow to search, insert and/or delete.
